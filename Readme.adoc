= Collect documentation from Rust code

This little helper library contains a `CollectDocs` derive macro.
Add it to your structs like this:

[source,rust]
----
use derive_collect_docs::CollectDocs;

/// Very essential type to out application
#[derive(Debug, CollectDocs)]
pub struct Foo {
    /// Amount of pressure to apply
    ///
    /// CAUTION: Will be renamed to appropriate SI unit in next release.
    bar: usize,
    /// Description of this Foo
    baz: String,
}
----

And get documentation like this
(with the correct heading that does not work in quoted asciidoc):

====
= Foo

Very essential type to out application


.Fields

* `bar` _(required)_
+
Amount of pressure to apply
+
CAUTION: Will be renamed to appropriate SI unit in next release.

* `baz` _(required)_
